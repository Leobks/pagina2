        <p>paiN Gaming is a Brazilian esports organization. They were the first Latin American organization to have a gaming house.<p>
            
            <p>In early 2013, paiN released their support MiT and top Tittu, acquiring Espeon and Venon. The team then won Riot Season 3 Brazilian Championship, which granted them a spot at the Riot Season 3 Int. Wildcard Tournament. They went 3-1 in the group stage, winning their game against GamingGear.eu, but lost in the finals to the CIS team, who attended the Season 3 World Championship instead of them.</p>
            
            <p>After losing at the IWC 2013, paiN decided to part ways with Espeon and pick up Minerva. With that roster, they placed second at IEM Season VIII - Sao Paulo. Then, brTT left to play for Keyd Stars and paiN fell into a rough patch, until they picked up Koreans Lactea and Olleh. With the two Korean bot laners, they won XMA - International Challenge 2014 and Razer Challenge Brasil Season 2, but fell short to Keyd Stars and to CNB e-Sports Club at Riot Brazilian Champion League 2014 and the 2014 Season Brazil Regional Finals, respectively</p>

            <p>After winning the Brazilian Qualifier (which also qualified them to the CBLOL), paiN Gaming qualified as the Brazilian team for IEM San Jose. They attended with a roster consisting of Leko, SirT, Kami, Lactea, and Olleh and were eliminated in the quarterfinals, losing to Cloud9 0-2 and tying for fifth place in the tournament with Lyon Gaming.
            </p>
            <p>paiN had to release their Korean bot lane due to visa problems, and instead brought brTT and Dioud to the team. The team didn't click at first, placing fourth in the first split's regular season and then third in the playoffs. After they released Leko for Mylon, everyone had high hopes for the team, and despite a shaky start, they won the second split's playoffs, defeating INTZ Red, Keyd Stars and INTZ Team, with Kami in particular standing out as a carry of the team. They qualified for the IWCT Qualifier, and without dropping a single game the entire tournament qualified for the 2015 Season World Championship. Analyst rnglol's contributions to the team's success were particularly noted</p>
            <p>At Worlds, paiN were seed into Group A along with Flash Wolves, KOO Tigers, and Counter Logic Gaming. They picked up two wins in the group, against eventual group winners Flash Wolves in the first week and then against CLG in the second week, and their 2-4 overall record and 1-1 head-to-head with CLG left them tied for third place, not advancing from groups. Despite their immediate elimination, paiN's group stage run was seen as a major success: they were the first Wildcard team to win more than one game at a World Championship and also the first Wildcard team to finish higher than sole possession of last place in their group. Additionally, they looked good in some of their losses: their second game against Flash Wolves lasted 52 minutes and could have gone either way at multiple points.
